# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in [TBD] (). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Who are we](https://www.check-den-fakt.de/about) Who are we,
  * [Our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Check-den-Fakt/projects) is the 10k foot view of where we're going
  * Bugs? Github is where to report them (try to find the right repository, if you are unable to, we will move it ;-))

## Testing

Code commited to the master branches should be well tested. At best add unit tests ;-)

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include well documented code and unit tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:
